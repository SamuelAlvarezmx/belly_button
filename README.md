# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

##Overview

This project consisted in make an interactive page that would let know to different people that were tested for their bacteria in their belly buttons what types of bacteria were found in their samples. The way it works is to find their id and select it from the dropdown menu in order to see how their samples came out with different visualizations to make it more compehensible to them.
